# Facebook Data Deletion Policy

Last Updated: October 26, 2023

This Data Deletion Policy outlines how Facebook (Meta Platforms, Inc. and its affiliates) handles the deletion of user data for its products and services. We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing you with control over your information.

## 1. User-Initiated Data Deletion

You have the right to delete your data from Facebook's services. We offer the following methods for user-initiated data deletion:

### A. Deleting Individual Content:

*   You can delete individual posts, photos, videos, comments, and other content you have created or uploaded at any time through the respective product interfaces (e.g., your Facebook Profile, Messenger chats).
*   When you delete individual content, it is removed from public view and from your profile. We will initiate the deletion process from our systems.

### B. Deleting Your Facebook Account:

*   You can choose to **deactivate** your account or **permanently delete** your account.
*   **Deactivating your account** temporarily hides your profile and content from others on Facebook. You can reactivate your account at any time and restore your profile. Some information, like messages you've sent, may remain visible to others.
*   **Permanently deleting your account** will initiate a process to permanently erase your personal data from our systems. Once deleted, your account and all associated content (posts, photos, videos, etc.) cannot be recovered.

## 2. Deletion Process and Timeline

When you initiate a deletion request, whether for individual content or your entire account, we follow a specific process:

*   **Immediate Removal from Public View:** Your content or account will be removed from public view immediately upon your deletion request. This means others will no longer see it on Facebook.
*   **Grace Period (for account deletion):** For permanent account deletion, there is a short grace period (typically 30 days) during which you can cancel the deletion request and recover your account. This is to prevent accidental deletions.
*   **Deletion from our Systems:** After the grace period (for account deletion) or immediately (for individual content), we begin the process of securely and completely removing your data from our backup and disaster recovery systems. This process can take up to 90 days from the beginning of the deletion process.
*   **Residual Data:** Some data may remain in our backup systems for a limited period due to technical reasons, but it will be isolated from live systems and subject to strict security measures. This residual data is retained only as necessary for legitimate business purposes (e.g., to comply with legal obligations, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our Terms of Service).
*   **Content Shared by Others:** Content that you have shared with others and that they have not deleted (e.g., messages you sent to friends, or posts you were tagged in by others) may remain visible even after your account is deleted. We do not control content that others have shared or copied.

## 3. Data Not Covered by Direct Deletion

In some limited circumstances, certain types of data may not be immediately deleted or may be retained for longer periods:

*   **Legal Obligations:** We may retain certain data if required by law or legal process. This includes responding to legitimate requests from law enforcement agencies or complying with court orders.
*   **Harmful Conduct Prevention:** We may retain data that is necessary to detect, prevent, or investigate harmful conduct, such as violations of our Terms of Service or Community Standards, for a longer period to protect the safety and security of our users and our services.
*   **Technical Logs and System Records:** Some technical log data and system records that are not directly identifiable to you may be retained for operational and security purposes.

## 4. Third-Party Data

This policy applies to data held by Facebook. When you use third-party applications, websites, or services connected to Facebook (e.g., by logging in with Facebook Login), those third parties may collect and retain your data according to their own privacy and data deletion policies. We encourage you to review the policies of any third-party services you use.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices
