These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Facebook and the products, features, apps, services, technologies, and software we offer (the "Facebook Products" or "Products"), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply.

## 1. The Services We Provide

We agree to provide you with the Facebook Products. The Products are made up of the following:

*   **Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest you:** We show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many businesses and organizations that use Facebook Products.
