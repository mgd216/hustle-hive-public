# Facebook Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 26, 2023

This Privacy Policy describes how Meta Platforms, Inc. and its affiliates ("Facebook," "we," "us," or "our") collect, use, and share your personal information when you use our Facebook products and services (collectively, the "Services").

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide better services to all our users. The types of information we collect depend on how you use our Services.

### A. Information you provide to us directly:

*   **Account Information:** When you create an account, you provide personal data such as your name, email address, phone number, password, date of birth, and gender.
*   **Content and Information you post:** We collect the content, communications, and other information you provide when you use our Services, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the date a file was created.
*   **Communications:** When you communicate with us, we collect the content of those communications.

### B. Information we collect automatically:

*   **Usage Information:** We collect information about your activity on our Services, such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities.
*   **Device Information:** We collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs, and other web-connected devices you use that integrate with our Services, and we combine this information across different devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Services on your phone to better personalize the content or features you see when you use our Services on another device, such as your laptop or tablet.
*   **Location Information:** We collect information about your location, such as through precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
*   **Cookies and Similar Technologies:** We use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your activity on our Services, to help us provide, protect, and improve the Services.

### C. Information from third parties:

*   **Partners:** Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through the Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plugins (like the Like button), Facebook Login, and APIs.
*   **Other users:** We may receive information about you from other users. For example, when other users tag you in a photo, comment, or message.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

*   **Provide, personalize and improve our Services:** We use your information to deliver our Services, personalize content, and make suggestions for you, such as showing you relevant posts, stories, ads, and people you may know.
*   **Develop, research and innovate:** We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Services, including by conducting surveys and research, and testing new products and features.
*   **Promote safety, integrity and security:** We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Services, and promote safety and security on and off of Facebook.
*   **Communicate with you:** We use your information to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Services, and let you know about our policies and terms.
*   **Show and measure ads and services:** We use the information we have to improve our advertising and measurement systems so we can show you relevant ads on and off our Services and measure the effectiveness and reach of ads and services.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

We share your information in the following ways:

*   **People and accounts you share and communicate with:** When you share and communicate using our Services, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you post on your Timeline, you select the audience for the post, such as Public, Friends, or a custom group.
*   **Public information:** Your public information is visible to everyone, both on and off our Services, even if they don't have a Facebook account.
*   **Third-Party Partners:** We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Services or who use the Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses.
    *   **Advertisers:** We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission.
    *   **Measurement Partners:** We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.
    *   **Vendors and Service Providers:** We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments, or conducting academic research and surveys.
*   **Law Enforcement or Legal Requests:** We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests if we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.

## 4. Your Rights and Choices

You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used:

*   **Access and Correction:** You can access and update your information through your Facebook settings.
*   **Deletion:** You can delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later.
*   **Opt-Out of Marketing Communications:** You can unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in the email.
*   **Privacy Settings:** You can adjust your privacy settings to control who can see your posts, photos, and other information.
*   **Location Information:** You can disable location services on your device or in your Facebook settings to prevent us from collecting certain location information.

## 5. Data Retention

We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and products or until your account is deleted, whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from your search history at any time.

## 6. How We Protect Your Information

We work hard to protect your account and information using technical and administrative security measures like HTTPS, two-factor authentication, and data encryption. We also constantly review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems.

## 7. International Data Transfers

We share your information globally, both internally within Meta and externally with our partners and with people you connect with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy.

## 8. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
